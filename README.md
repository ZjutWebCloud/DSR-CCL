# Description of the model file
1. The main model structure is implemented in file dsr_model.py<br>
2. dataset.py implements a hypergraph-based recommendation for modeling user-service and mashup-API interactions.<br>
3. Attention and related layers are implemented in Attention.py<br>
4. PredictLayer.py defines a neural network prediction layer for recommendation tasks.<br>
5. The training process is implemented in dsr-ccl_train.py, including data preprocessing, Data Augmentation, training and test set reading, metrics calling, and training process.<br>
