# Description of the model file
1.The main model structure is implemented in file dsr_model.py<br>
-2.dataset.py implements a hypergraph-based recommendation for modeling user-service and mashup-API interactions.<br>
-3.Attention and related layers are implemented in Attention.py
-4.PredictLayer.py defines a neural network prediction layer for recommendation tasks.
-5.The training process is implemented in dsr-ccl_train.py,including data preprocessing, Data Augmentation, training and test set reading, metrics calling, and training process.
